# TODO

Tracked tasks and future features for the UN Project web application.

## Near-term (data already in DB)

- [ ] **Speaker role / title** — the `speakers` table has `role` and `title` columns; populate
  them from the data and display on the speaker page.

## Awaiting data / extractor work

- [ ] **Amendment tracking** — the `amendments` table is reserved; implement models and UI
  when data is ready.

## Future / Research

- [ ] **LLM summarization** — use the Claude API to generate concise debate summaries per
  agenda item, displayed as a collapsible section on the meeting page.

- [ ] **Sentiment / position analysis** — classify speeches as supportive, critical, or
  neutral toward a resolution using the Claude API.
